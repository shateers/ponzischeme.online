# PonziSchemes.online 🚨
A community-driven platform to expose Ponzi schemes and help people stay safe.  
Think **Glassdoor for scams** — users can upload Ponzi schemes, review them anonymously, and share red flags.  

## 🎯 Vision
Millions lose money to scams each year. While many Ponzi schemes are illegal, others (like MLMs or timeshare contracts) are legal but exploitative.  
This project aims to **educate, warn, and protect people** by building an open platform.

## 🛠 Features (MVP)
- Submit new Ponzi schemes with details.
- Anonymous reviews (pros, cons, money lost, red flags).
- Star rating system (trust score).
- Search & filter scams by type, location, and rating.
- Scam awareness guides + reporting resources.

## 🤝 How You Can Contribute
- Developers → help build backend (Node/Django) & frontend (React/Next.js).  
- Designers → wireframes, UI/UX suggestions.  
- Writers → scam awareness guides, blog content.  
- Researchers → collect data on existing Ponzi/MLM scams.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack (Suggested)
- Frontend: React / Next.js + TailwindCSS  
- Backend: Node.js (Express) or Django REST  
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (with ElasticSearch for search)
